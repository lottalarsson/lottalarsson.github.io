Fiskehallen in Oslo has long been an important part of the fish industry. 
But as the harbour slowly is developing from an industrial area to a more public area in the city, 
the facilities need new to convert into a multifunctional space for both industri and public. 

Nytt stycke. Lägg in en bild såhär (notera att du måste börja med ett / i filsökvägen):

Fiskehallen in the old days. A few days a week the building was open for public. You could buy fish directly from the fishermen.
Something the project tries to go back to.

The proposal for a new building added on the facade of the building, on the roof and on the harbour shore.
